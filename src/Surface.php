/**
 * A Surface is a 2-dimensional geometric object.
 *
 * A simple Surface may consists of a single "patch" that is associated with one "exterior boundary" and 0 or more
 * "interior" boundaries. A single such Surface patch in 3-dimensional space is isometric to planar Surfaces, by a
 * simple affine rotation matrix that rotates the patch onto the plane z = 0. If the patch is not vertical,
 * the projection onto the same plane is an isomorphism, and can be represented as a linear transformation,
 * i.e. an affine.
 *
 * Polyhedral Surfaces are formed by "stitching" together such simple Surfaces patches along their common
 * boundaries. Such polyhedral Surfaces in a 3-dimensional space may not be planar as a whole, depending on the
 * orientation of their planar normals. If all the patches are in alignment (their normals are parallel),
 * then the whole stitched polyhedral surface is co-planar and can be represented as a single patch if it is connected.
 *
 * The boundary of a simple Surface is the set of closed Curves corresponding to its "exterior" and "interior"
 * boundaries.
